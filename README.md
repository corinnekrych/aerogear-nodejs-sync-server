## Development

### Running tests

    $ npm test

To run a single test you can use:

    $ node test/sync-engine-test.js | node_modules/tap-spec/bin/cmd.js

### Debugging
If you are using Node 7.x you can use the `--inspect --debug-brk` command line options to debug code, for example:

    $ node --inspect --debug-brk test/sync-engine-test.js | node_modules/tap-spec/bin/cmd.js
    Debugger listening on port 9229.
    Warning: This is an experimental feature and could change at any time.
    To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:
    chrome-devtools://devtools/remote/serve_file/@60cd6e859b9f557d2312f5bf532f6aec5f284980/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=localhost:9229/9840e0cc-0603-47e1-a817-14989ab71f57

> On previous version of Node, use [devtool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devtool):
> devtool test/sync-engine-test.js

### Running ESlint

    $ npm run lint

### Debugging

#### Enable logging
Logging can be enable by setting the `NODE_DEBUG` environment variable to the name of the JavaScript source file you want to enable logging for. For example:

    $ env NODE_DEBUG=sync-engine node index.js

Multiple JavaScript files can be added if you are interested in more than one by comma separating them.
