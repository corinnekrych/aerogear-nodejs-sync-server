## Development

### Running tests

    $ npm test

To run a single test you can use:

    $ node test/sync-engine-test.js | node_modules/tap-spec/bin/cmd.js

### Debugging
If you are using Node 7.x you can use the `--inspect --debug-brk` command line options to debug code, for example:

    $ node --inspect --debug-brk test/sync-engine-test.js | node_modules/tap-spec/bin/cmd.js
    Debugger listening on port 9229.
    Warning: This is an experimental feature and could change at any time.
    To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:
